Hello! I'm [Kyle Isom](http://www.kyleisom.net) and I've recently drunk
the [Go](http://www.golang.org) koolaid. As I learn the language, I find
it to be a useful cross between C and Python, the two languages I am most
familiar with.

You can view my [list of projects in Go](/projects/) or browse through
some of the [articles](/articles/) I've written on the language.

The gophers that appear on this site come from the [Go homepage](http://www.golang.org)
