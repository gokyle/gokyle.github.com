Hello! I'm [Kyle Isom](http://www.kyleisom.net) and I've recently drunk
the [Go](http://www.golang.org) koolaid. As I learn the language, I find
it to be a useful cross between C and Python, the two languages I am most
familiar with.

You can view my [list of projects in Go](/projects/), browse through
some of the [articles](/articles/) I've written on the language,
take a look at the [talks](/talks/) I've given, or view my
[profile](https://github.com/gokyle/) on Github. I am also working
on a book titled
["Practical Cryptography With Go"](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto).

I can be contacted via 'kyle' at this domain, or from the
[contact page](http://kyleisom.net/about/) on my
[homepage](http://kyleisom.net).
