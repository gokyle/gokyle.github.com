I'm currently working on a book titled *Practical Cryptography with Go*. It's
being published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com). This means that if you
purchase the book, you get updates as they're being published, and support my
writing habit at the same time. You can get it from the
[Leanpub page](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto).

The book is aimed at Go developers who are familiar with the language, but
not with cryptography. It doesn't aim to teach the theory of cryptography,
but rather provide a blueprint showing how to effectively use cryptography
in your code, and when you should use it. I assume you aren't terribly
familiar with crypto, and strive explain what you need to know to use
it properly, and I lay out a set of best practises so you don't need to
worry about picking a particular cipher. The book bases these choices
on the NIST guidelines, particular the FIPS publications.

I'll keep this page updated with the book's progress.

I'm contemplating adding some chapters on the OpenPGP packages and
OTR packages, but we'll see how turns out once I get further along.
