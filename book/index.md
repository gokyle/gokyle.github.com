I'm currently working on a book titled *Practical Cryptography with Go*. It's
being published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com). This means that if you
purchase the book, you get updates as they're being published, and support my
writing habit at the same time. You can get it from the
[Leanpub page](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto).

The book is aimed at Go developers who are familiar with the language, but
not with cryptography. It doesn't aim to teach the theory of cryptography,
but rather provide a blueprint showing how to effectively use cryptography
in your code, and when you should use it. I assume you aren't terribly
familiar with crypto, and strive explain what you need to know to use
it properly, and I lay out a set of best practises so you don't need to
worry about picking a particular cipher. The book bases these choices
on the NIST guidelines, particular the FIPS publications.

I'll keep this page updated with the book's progress.

<h3>The first draft of the book is now complete!</h3>

I'm contemplating adding some chapters on the OpenPGP packages and
OTR packages, but we'll see how turns out once I get further along.

Update: I've decided to split out the examples of using existing crypto
systems into a separate (free) book. Stay tuned for more information.

Courtesy of a critical review, I'm in the process of rewriting the
book. Having written it once already, I have an outline -- but now I'm
waiting to publish each chapter until I can get a quality technical
review on them.
