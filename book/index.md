I'm currently working on a book titled *Practical Cryptography with Go*. It's
being published on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com). This means that if you
purchase the book, you get updates as they're being published, and support my
writing habit at the same time. You can get it from the
[Leanpub page](https://leanpub.com/gocrypto).

The book is aimed at Go developers who are familiar with the language, but
not with Go. It doesn't aim to teach the theory of cryptography, but rather
provide a blueprint showing how to effectively use cryptography in your
code, and when you should use it. I assume you aren't terribly familiar with
crypto, and strive explain what you need to know to use it properly, and I
lay out a set of best practises so you don't need to worry about picking a
particular cipher. The book bases these choices on the FIPS guidelines.

I'll keep this page updated with the book's progress.
