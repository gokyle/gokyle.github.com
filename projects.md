![Go gophers from the Go homepage](/images/gopher/project.png)

* [gotoma](https://github.com/gokyle/gotoma) is a command line tool
for doing pomodoros.

* [say](https://github.com/gokyle/say) is a command line interface to
festival, inspired by the OS X command `say`.

* [gack](https://github.com/gokyle/gack) is an [ack](http://betterthangrep.com/)
clone written in Go. It currently supports basic querying and file listings, 
but has a long ways to go to beat ack's performance.

* [golobsters](http://gokyle.github.com/golobsters/) is an application
running on [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com) that posts new stories from
[lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) to [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lobsternews).

* [gomon](http://gokyle.github.com/gomon/) provides basic runtime monitoring 
and program restarts for Go programs. It was adapted from a Python module I
wrote for keeping a Bitcoin trading system online.

* [gopush](http://gokyle.github.com/gopush/) provides [Pushover](https://www.pusover.net)
notifications from Go.
